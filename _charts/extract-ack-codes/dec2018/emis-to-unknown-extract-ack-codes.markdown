A chart representing the ExtractAckCodes for messages from the sender to the requestor.

The data was collected from **Splunk** with the following query for the whole of **December 2018**:

This is the query that gave us information on the **ExtractAckCode**, specifically where this maps **00** to **0**, as we have assumed all the 0s are a success.
```sql
index="gp2gp-mi" sourcetype="gppractice-RR"     
  | where RequestFailurePoint=0 OR RequestFailurePoint=60      
  | join type=outer RequestorODS
      [search index="gp2gp-mi" sourcetype="gppractice-HR"]      
  | join type=outer SenderODS          
      [search index="gp2gp-mi" sourcetype="gppractice-HR"            
  | rename RequestorODS as SenderODS            
  | rename RequestorSoftware as SenderSoftware]     
  | rex field=RequestorSoftware        
      "(?<RequestorSupplier>.*)_(?<RequestorSystem>.*)_(?<RequestorVersion>.*)"     
  | eval RequestorSupplier=coalesce(RequestorSupplier, RequestorSupplier, "Unknown")     
  | rex field=SenderSoftware        
      "(?<SenderSupplier>.*)_(?<SenderSystem>.*)_(?<SenderVersion>.*)"     
  | lookup Spine2-NACS-Lookup NACS AS SenderODS OUTPUTNEW MName AS MName
