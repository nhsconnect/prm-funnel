**THIS PAGE WILL BE COMPLETED AT A LATER DATE**
A chart representing the details of Small messages.

The data was collected from **Splunk** with the following query, and the date range was **1st-31st January 2019**:

This is the query that gave us information on the **RequestAckCode**, specifically where this was not **0** or **00**, as we have assumed the 0s are a success.
```sql
INSERT
```
