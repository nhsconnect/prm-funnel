A chart representing the details EHR extract success by pathway.

The data was collected from **Splunk** with the following query, and the date range was **1st-<Month:LastDate> <Month> <Year>**:

```sql

  | join type=outer SenderODS [search index="gp2gp-mi" sourcetype="gppractice-HR"
      | rename RequestorODS as SenderODS
      | rename RequestorSoftware as SenderSoftware]
  | rex field=SenderSoftware "(?<SenderSupplier>.*)_(?<SenderSystem>.*)_(?<SenderVersion>.*)"
  | eval SenderSupplier=coalesce(SenderSupplier, "Unknown")
  | join type=outer RequestorODS [search index="gp2gp-mi" sourcetype="gppractice-HR"]
