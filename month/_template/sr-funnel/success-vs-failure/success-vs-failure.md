The same information is represented **[broken down into supplier pathways](/prm-funnel/month/<Year-Month-Directory>/sr-funnel/success-vs-failure/pathways/pathways.html)**

The data was collected from **Splunk** with the following query, and the date range was **1st-<Month:LastDate> <Month> <Year>**:

```sql

  | eval SenderSupplier=coalesce(SenderSupplier, "Unknown")
