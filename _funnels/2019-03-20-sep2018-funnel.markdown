Whilst the **EHR Requests Sent**, **EHR Extracts Sent** and **Successfully Integrated** data is sourced from **suppliers' data - September 2018**, the **Registrations** data is collated from the **Monthly CCG GP2GP Utilisation Report - July 2018**, as that is the most recent data we have available.
